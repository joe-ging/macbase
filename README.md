**The ChessBase alternative Mac users have been waiting for.**

## 🌎 Open Core & Community

Macbase follows an **Open Core** model. The repository you see here contains the **Community Core**—the foundational engine, database architecture, and native macOS desktop environment. 

We believe professional tools should be accessible to everyone, which is why the core is open source. To sustain development, proprietary features (like advanced tactical arrows, professional insights, and the TWIC auto-sync service) are part of the **Pro Beta** distribution.
